We're doing a "soft launch" of our catalog site over the next several weeks. We've loaded a bunch of author and work authority records, and we'll be adding lots of records of individual items from HathiTrust, the Internet Archive, and other sites in the coming days and weeks. In the meantime, there is a lot of information about the catalog, and you can get a taste of what's to come at <https://catalog.digitallatin.org>. As always, we welcome your feedback.
