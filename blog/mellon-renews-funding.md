The DLL received official word today that the [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org) has approved a grant of $1,000,000 to the University of Oklahoma "to support development of infrastructure for creation, use, and publication of scholarly editions and original primary sources."

The letter, addressed to OU President David Boren, states that disbursement of the funds is contingent upon execution of an intellectual property agreement, which will be the next step.

Congratulations to the DLL team!
