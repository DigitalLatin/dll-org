The Digital Latin Library, a joint project of the Society for Classical Studies, the Medieval Academy of America, and the Renaissance Society of America, with funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, announces a seminar on Latin textual criticism in the digital age. The seminar will take place on the campus of the University of Oklahoma, the DLL's host institution, on June 25â€“26, 2015.

We welcome proposals for papers on all subjects related to the intersection of modern technology with traditional methods for editing Latin texts of all eras. Suggested topics:

- Keeping the "critical" in digital critical editions
- The scholarly value of editing texts to be read by humans and machines
- Extending the usability of critical editions beyond a scholarly audience
- Visualizing the critical apparatus: moving beyond a print-optimized format
- Encoding different critical approaches to a text
- Interoperability between critical editions and other digital resources
- Dreaming big: a wishlist of features for the optimal digital editing environment

Of particular interest are proposals that examine the scholarly element of preparing a digital edition.

The seminar will be limited to ten participants. Participants will receive a stipend, and all travel and related expenses will be paid by the DLL.

Please send proposals of no more than 650 words to Samuel J. Huskey at [dll-seminar@ou.edu](mailto:dll-seminar@ou.edu) by December 1, 2014. Notification of proposal status will be sent in early January.
