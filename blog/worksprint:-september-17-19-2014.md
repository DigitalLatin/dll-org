Over the next two days, the DLL will host Tom Elliott, Hugh Cayless, Jim Ginther, and Patrick Cuba in Norman for discussion about technical specifications for the DLL's _Library of Digital Latin Texts_ and the possibility of cross-compatibility with _[Tradamus](http://www.slu.edu/center-for-digital-humanities/projects/current-projects/tradamus)_ , a web-based application for the creation and publication of scholarly digital editions.
