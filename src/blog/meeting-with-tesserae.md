The DLL hosted representatives of the [Tesserae Project](http://tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu) from June 3 to June 5 in Norman. Neil Coffee, the director of Tesserae and associate professor of Classics at the University of Buffalo, brought project assistants James Gawley and Caitlin Diddams with him to discuss their work on the project and their plans for developing Tesserae into a web service. We're excited about the possibility of incorporating Tesserae into the DLL's sandbox so that users can use Tesserae's sophisticated search and text comparison features.
