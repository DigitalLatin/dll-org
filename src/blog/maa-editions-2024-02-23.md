We're pleased to announce the publication of three editions in the _Library of Digital Latin Texts_(LDLT), in partnership with the [Medieval Academy of America](https://www.medievalacademy.org/).

These editions are part of a larger project, the [Scholastic Commentaries and Texts Archive](https://scta.info/), under the direction of [Jeffrey C. Witt](https://jeffreycwitt.com/).

The LDLT is a good option for scholars like Witt and his collaborators. First and foremost, **peer review** is the foundation of the LDLT's publishing pipeline. In this case, the MAA managed the peer review process; our two other partners, the Society for Classical Studies and the Renaissance Society of America, handle the peer review process for texts in their scholarly domains. Second, editors retain the copyright to their work, and they can freely use the texts in their own projects. Third, since the LDLT can publish texts of any length, it's a good choice for publishing all of a work or excerpts. Finally, the LDLT does not have the same concerns that drive commercial presses, so we can publish texts that might not otherwise have an outlet.

Another benefit to publishing in the LDLT is that editions are published as version-controlled repositories of source files. This means that editions are not tightly bound to interfaces that can and do become obsolete as technology advances. We do provide some tools for rendering the code and viewing the editions online and in print, but we maintain a strict division between an edition's code and its visualization.

Since the editions by Witt et al. are part of the [Scholastic Commentaries and Texts Archive](https://scta.info/), which has its own interfaces and viewing environment, we're providing links to the texts as they appear there.
