The Digital Latin Library project announces a workshop on the preparation of critical editions of Latin texts according to the soon-to-be-released encoding guidelines for the Library of Digital Latin Texts (LDLT), a series of new, born-digital editions to be published under the auspices of the Society for Classical Studies, the Medieval Academy of America, and the Renaissance Society of America. The workshop will be held on the campus of the University of Oklahoma, the DLL’s institutional home, on June 29–30, 2017.

The LDLT guidelines aim to facilitate the creation of full critical editions—with prefatory materials, text, critical apparatus, and other common features of traditional editions—in a digital format that will open up new possibilities for scholarship. For example, texts encoded according to the guidelines can be used with digital tools that provide new ways of working with the information, from a text viewer that allows readers to evaluate variant readings by swapping them in and out of the text, to dynamic data visualization apps that show how different versions of the text relate to each other.

Participants in the workshop will learn about the encoding guidelines and see demonstrations of some of the applications that will be released later this year. They will also spend time working with facilitators who can answer questions and provide advice about how to apply the guidelines to their projects.

Applications are invited from anyone who would like to learn about the Library of Digital Latin Texts and the potential of born-digital critical editions, but preference will be given to applicants with existing projects. Applications should include:

1. A statement of interest, describing how the applicant will benefit from participating in the workshop,
2. A description of the applicant’s existing project (if there is one),
3. A brief description of the applicant’s experience with both textual editing and digital technology.

These items should be in a single PDF document of no more than 1000 words.

Prior experience with XML and related technology is not required.

The Digital Latin Library will pay for participants’ airfare, hotel accommodation, local transportation, meals, and per diem expenses. For this reason, seating in the workshop is limited.

Send all application materials by email as a single PDF to [dll-workshop@ou.edu](mailto:dll-workshop@ou.edu). The deadline for applications is March 10. Applicants will be notified by April 1, 2017.

Questions may be directed to [dll-workshop@ou.edu](mailto:dll-workshop@ou.edu).
