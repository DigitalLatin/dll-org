Anyone with access to a networked computer and some knowledge of Latin can publish texts on the Internet, in the sense of making a text publicly available, but many Latin texts currently online lack a critical apparatus, the hallmark of a reliable, scholarly edition. Those that do have a critical apparatus usually lack the backing of a scholarly publisher and the legitimation that comes from review by oneâ€™s peers.

Although editorial practices differ among scholars working on classical, medieval, and humanist texts, our user studies have demonstrated that there is general agreement that a viable digital format specifically for critical editions and commentaries of Latin texts, combined with a legitimate forum in which to publish them, would advance the field of Latin studies.

Accordingly, the mission of the DLL's _Library of Digital Latin Texts_ is to provide standards, practices, and policies for creating, publishing, and working with born-digital critical editions of Latin texts from all eras.
