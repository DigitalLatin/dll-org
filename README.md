# Digital Latin Library Main Site

This is the repository for the web site published at <https://digitallatin.org/>.

This version of the site replaces an earlier one that ran on the dynamic content management system [Drupal](https://drupal.org/) 7. It now runs on the static site generator [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), with [11ty-plain-bootstrap5](https://mandrasch.github.io/11ty-plain-bootstrap5/) as a starter theme.

[Samuel J. Huskey](https://sjhuskey.info/) designed and maintains this site.
